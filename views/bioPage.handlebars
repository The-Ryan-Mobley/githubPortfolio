                    &#x9Hello and welcome to my website! I am a Full-Stack developer with a certificate in Full Stack Web 
                    Development from the University of Texas Austin Coding Bootcamp. I am skilled in both backend development 
                    specializing in Nodejs, and frontend javascript with React. I am a detail oriented-problem solver, 
                    I work very well under stressful situations; while maintaining enough of my sense of humor to collaborate with 
                    a team in a productive and  friendly manner. Whenever I work with a team if i'm not leading the project’s design, 
                    I am the workhorse guaranteeing it’s deployment.<br>
                    I've loved computers all my life. My hope is that I can give back to the world of programming. 
                    I also love to create, and one of my greatest joys in life is the freedom, and infinite possibilities 
                    that has been opened up to me thanks to my ability to code. In my time as a developer I have been able to work on a myriad
                    of projects with a plethora of technologies, and creative directions. It is my hope that I can bring that same
                    spark, and sense of wonder that has drawn me to this field throughout my personal life into my professional career.<br>
                    Some of my strengths include: Database management with both SQL and no SQL databases adhering to the
                    MVC design pattern. Building powerful and dynamic webpages with React and Redux. Designing responsive
                    page layouts using CSS and a variety of frameworks such as: Bootstrap, Materialize, and Material UI.
                    But don't just take my word for it! Feel free to look at the list of projects I've worked on by clicking
