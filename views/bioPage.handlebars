                    &#x9Hello and welcome to my website! I've loved computers all my life. My hope is that I can give back 
                    to the world of programming. I also love to create, and one of my greatest joys in life is the freedom
                    and, infinite possibilities that has been opened up to me thanks to the ability to code. <br>
                    I am a Full-Stack developer with a certification in Full Stack Web Development from the 
                    University of Texas Austin Coding Bootcamp. I am skilled in both backend with Node, and frontend 
                    with React. I am a detail oriented-problem solver, I work very well under stressful situations; 
                    while maintaining enough of my sense of humor to collaborate with a team in a productive and 
                    friendly manner. Whenever I work with a team if i'm not leading the project’s design, I am the 
                    workhorse guaranteeing it’s deployment.<br>
                    Some of my strengths include: Database management with both SQL and no SQL databases adhering to the
                    MVC design pattern. Building powerful and dynamic webpages with React and Redux. Designing responsive
                    page layouts using CSS and a variety of frameworks such as: Bootstrap, Materialize, and Material UI.
